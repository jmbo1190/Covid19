# Covid19

The purpose of this project is to generate visualizations (in R markdown) to help follow the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on Belgium and Hospitalizations.

Why hospitalizations?  
Because 'flattening the curve' to avoid overwhelming hospitals is the primary objective of the government's social distancing policy.
It's also the most precise type of data available.  Indeed mortality data in Belgium includes suspicious deaths occurring outside the hospitals for which proof of Covid-19 infection is generally lacking, so this is likely to be overestimated.  Infection rates on the other hand are likely to be underestimated due to the lack of systematic testing. 

Comments and suggestions are encouraged.
